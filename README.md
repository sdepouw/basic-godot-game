# Mathematics and Cheese

A basic game created in Godot using GDScript.

## Playable Online

[Play the latest prototype up on itch.io](https://doctorblue.itch.io/mathematics-and-cheese?password=Bluey)!

In Firefox, you might get a "404 not found" screen when attempting to start the game. If you do, try a different browser.

## Development Tracking

## Mission Statement

My goal is to build a game from scratch that contains basic features and functionality. The gameplay itself will be very familiar and hardly innovative, but this, like my [Godot Sandbox](https://github.com/sdepouw/GodotSandbox), is meant as an exercise in improvement and learning more than designing something to be put up for sale.

## GDScript vs. C#

Prior to this, I developed Godot's 2D tutorial game using both GDScript and C#. I like GDScript, but vastly prefer C#. However, support for exporting Godot projects to make them playable on the web is not available for C#. For this reason, **I'm electing to use GDScript for this project.**

I did have fun exploring how to organize a project when it was built in C#. I think I can transport some of those concepts back into GDScript (despite my best efforts to fit my "I want strongly typed everything" square peg into GDScript's "dynamic typing" round hole).
